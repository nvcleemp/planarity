This code project provides a library for implementing graph algorithms as well as implementations of several planarity-related graph algorithms.  The origin of this project is the reference implementation for the  [Edge Addition Planarity Algorithm](http://dx.doi.org/10.7155/jgaa.00091), which is now the **fastest** and **simplest** linear-time method for planar graph embedding and planarity obstruction isolation (i.e. Kuratowski subgraph isolation).

The software in this code project provides a graph algorithm framework and library, including an updated version of the edge addition combinatorial planar graph embedder and planar obstruction isolator (i.e., a Kuratowski subgraph isolator).  This code project also includes several extensions that implement planarity-related algorithms such as a [planar graph drawing algorithm](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/11618058_47), an outerplanar graph embedder and outerplanar obstruction isolator, and a number of [subgraph homeomorphism search algorithms](http://dx.doi.org/10.7155/jgaa.00268).

Over time, the library will grow to contain more planarity-related extension algorithms as well as some graph algorithms that are not strictly related to planarity. For example, this project now contains a graph coloring algorithms that ensures a five-coloring or better for any planar graph.  See the [Roadmap](http://code.google.com/p/planarity/wiki/Roadmap) for the future plans of this project.

There has been successful technology transfer of this planarity algorithm into other projects, including [Boost](http://www.boost.org/) ([bibl](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_43_0/libs/graph/doc/bibliography.html)), [LinKnot](http://math.ict.edu.rs:8080/webMathematica/LinkSL/cont.htm) ([bibl](http://math.ict.edu.rs:8080/webMathematica/LinkSL/bibl.htm)),  [Magma](http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/) ([bibl](http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/htmlhelp/text1707.htm)), [Nauty](http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/nauty/) ([doc](http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/nauty/nug.pdf)), and [Sage](http://www.sagemath.org/) ([bibl](http://www.sagemath.org/development-ack.html)).
